# Movie Recommendation System

This is a full stack, immediately deployable application that hosts a backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL database server. 

There are three elements of this program: The backend, frontend, and postgreSQL database. 

The goal of this program is to use vector similarity searches to recommend movies to users. The techniques in this project are training-free, except for the embedding model. 

The backend is written with Python and FastAPI. 

To run this program, please first compile all three Docker environments. Please cd into the project root folder and run:

```zsh
docker compose up
```
